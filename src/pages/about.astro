    <h2>... and this new Astro Site</h2>

    <p>
      I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second
      page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!
    </p>

    <p>
      This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking
      back and see how my journey is going!
    </p>

    <p>here are a few facts about me:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
        <li>I live in {identity.country} and I "work" as a {identity.occupation}.</li>
        {identity.hobbies.length >= 2 &&
            <li>Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}</li>
        }
    </ul>
    <p>My skills are:</p>
    <ul>
        {skills.map((skill) => <li>{skill}</li> )}
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
